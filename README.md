# fairylight
USB-shaped PCB, and code to drive a charlieplexed fairylight LED string, using an ATTINY (exact model to be determined.)

Currently testing this with a ATTINY85 Digispark board, but my end goal is to have a small USB sized PCB, with the microcontroller, button, and potentially an IR receiver to change pattern settings.
